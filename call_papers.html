						<h2>Call for Papers</h2>
					</header>
					
					<p class="align-left"> 
					All submitted contributions will be peer-reviewed and evaluated on the basis of the quality of 
					submission, originality, and breath of interest. We especially welcome contributions on emerging topics that 
					have the potential to encourage discussions. Industrial applications and position papers that present novel ideas, 
					issues, challenges and directions are also welcome. Specifically we solicit the following two types of submissions 
					(please indicate the type of your submission on the first page of the submission):
					</p>
					<ol class="align-left">
						<li> <b>Research papers</b> that report the results of new, recent, or ongoing research, emphasizing either on theory side or 
							application side or both.</li> 
					 	<li> <b>Challenge/Position papers</b> that describe a vision for how incentives in ML should evolve as a field. </li>
					</ol>
					<p class="align-left">
					To foster and encourage a wide participation and discussion, there will be no formal workshop proceedings.
					</p>	
					<br>

						submission to other major venues in the field, and papers that have been accepted in relevant venues or published in the 
						past year, are encouraged. Papers that appeared on arXiv, but havenâ€™t been accepted for publication, are encouraged.
